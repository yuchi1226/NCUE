Part I
1. Find the number of ways to give 5 identical red pens and 4 identical blue pens to 3 children under the following conditions.(You can assume 3 children to be A,B,C, then discuss how to allocate red pens and blue pens to them respectively.)
    (a) Any combination of pens for the three children.
    (b) If one specific child needs to be assigned at least one pen(either red or blue).

2. Find the number of ways to divide 10 students into 4 groups [G1,G2,G3,G4] so that two of the four groups contain 3 students and the other two groups contain two students/

3. Consider the congruence equation 7x ≡ 1(mod 9), find the general solution of x.

4.Solve the following Boolean algebra.
    (a) express E(x,y,z) = x(xy,+y'+x'y) as it complete sum-of-products form (Hint: needs to consider z terms)
    (b) Find the Boolean expression E = E(x,y,z) corresponding to the truth tabley T(E) = 01001001

Part II

1. Define a sequence of numbers in the following way: G₀ = 0, G₁ = 1/2 and ∀k ≥ 0, Gₖ₊₂ = (Gₖ₊₁ + Gₖ)/2.
    (a) What are the values of G₄ and G₅
    (b) Give a matrix A such that 
          | Gₖ₊₁|  | Gₖ₊₂ |
        A | Gₖ  | =| Gₖ₊₁ |
    (c) Find an explicit formula for Gₖ.
    (d) What is the limit of Gₖ as k → ∞ ?

        | 1 |           |-2 |
    X₁ =| 1 |, and X₂ = |-1 |
        | 1 |           | 0 |
        | 0 |           | 1 |
    (a) Find the reduced row echelon form of A.
    (b) What are dimensions of Col(A), Row(A), and Null(A)?
        And justify yout answers.

3. Let H be a plane abd y be a given point ib R³
    (a) Let p be the orthogonal projection of y onto the plane H. Show that p is the point in H that is closet to y.
    
                | X₁|                               | 2 |
    (b) Let H={ | X₂| | X₁ + 2X₂ + X₃ = 4} and y =  | 3 |. Find p.
